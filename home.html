        Cars are everywhere in America. We build our 
        cities and suburbs around the use of the car. 
        As the most common way to get around, federal, 
        state, and city governments spend millions of tax dollars in 
        infrastructure for the car. However, this has led
        to detrimental effects on our towns and cities.
        <br><br>
        Our overreliance on the automobile is perpetually increasing money pit for tax dollars 
        on continual repairs of roads and highways, spread out our cities into vast sprawls, limiting 
        movement of the lower class who can not affored cars from important job opportunities, locking them in their 
        communities. As well as diverting funds from alternative forms of transportation, creating massive space issues 
        for cities with parking, producing an immense percentage of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and are greatly 
        unsafe for anyone else using the roads that belong to all of us.

        The overfunding on car infrastructure has diverted vital capital 
        away from other forms of transportation in our cities. Many cities throughout 
        America have inadequate bus services with few routes, and most cities do not 
        have rapid train transit at all.
